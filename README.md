This project is also an ongoing project is not finished yet. Still have a long way to get it finished. Updates also does not help a lot, since the obfuscated source code changes will require a lot of changes in this project's source code. Also, the game itself contains a lot of mathematical functions which are unknown to me right now, and it's hard to figure their purpose without testing on a running game. I'm currently working on this source code by only looking at it and renaming the known functions/variables based on assumptions, and this approach did not fail me yet.

Global variables are named with "g_" suffix.
